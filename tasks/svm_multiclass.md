### Assignment: svm_multiclass
#### Date: Deadline: Dec 01, 23:59
#### Points: 3 points
#### Examples: svm_multiclass_examples

Extend your solution to the `smo_algorithm` assignment to handle multiclass
classification, using the [svm_multiclass.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl129/tree/master/labs/07/svm_multiclass.py)
template.

#### Examples Start: svm_multiclass_examples
Note that your results may sometimes be slightly different (for example because of varying floating point arithmetic on your CPU).
- `python3 svm_multiclass.py --classes=5 --kernel=poly --kernel_degree=2 --test_size=0.8`
